# Exercise2
Code repository for Exercise 2 of NLP class, Master's in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics, Pompeu Fabra University.
Code created by Alba Prados Moya and Yutong Zhang.

*** 
### Exercise goal
In this study, we aimed to develop a character-based model capable of generating animal names in Chinese, adapting code from Andrej Karpathy’s lecture course[1]. This involved adjusting the original code, to effectively process Chinese characters and enhance the training process for better-quality outputs.

*** 
### Requirements
The code is written in python 3

Packages and libraries required:
  * torch
  * torch.nn.functional
  * matplotlib.pyplot
  * random
  
***

### Data

The dataset used in this study (animals_ch.txt) was sourced from a Chinese website[2], which provided an article containing approximately 500 animal names written in Chinese characters.
