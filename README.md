# Exercise2
Code repository for Exercise 2 of NLP class, Master's in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics, Pompeu Fabra University.
Code created by Alba Prados Moya and Yutong Zhang.

### Exercise goal
This assignment draws from a section of my Master’s Thesis, which focuses on analyzing findings from a preceding research paper on the EsCoLA: Spanish Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability[1] . My primary aim is to investigate whether the model's efficacy correlates with either word frequency or task complexity. Specifically, I've addressed the initial aspect of my thesis by developing a coding program to explore the association between word frequency within EsCoLA corpus sentences and the model's performance. This investigation aims to ascertain whether the model exhibits superior performance with sentences containing more common words, less common words, or if there's no discernible impact.

### Requirements
The code is written in python 3

Packages and libraries required:
  * pandas
  * re

### Data

The dataset used in this study (animal_names_ch.txt) was sourced from a Chinese website[2], which provided an article containing approximately 500 animal names written in Chinese characters.
